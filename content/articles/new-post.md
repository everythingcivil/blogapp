**What Makes a Building Green?**

Following examples can be considered for green buildings:

- Green buildings may incorporate sustainable materials in their construction (e.g., reused, recycled content, or made from renewable resources).
- Create healthy indoor environments with minimal pollutants (e.g., reduced product emissions).
- And feature landscaping that reduce water usage (e.g., by using native plants that survive without extra watering).
- A green building is a structure that is environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout its life-cycle. These objectives expand and complement the classical building design concerns of economy, utility. Durability and comfort.
