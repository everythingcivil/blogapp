description: Identifying vehicle classification, and traffic load classification
  plays an important role in traffic management and control. Road traffic is
  very much complex in nature due to interaction of various entities such as
  pedestrians, cars, trucks, busses, tramps, bicycles, etc.). Effectiveness in
  traffic planning, and road infrastructures maintenance could be improved by
  proper recognition and analysis of vehicles and traffic load.

In \[9], Dong et al. proposed a vehicle type classification method using a semi supervised convolutional neural network from vehicle frontal-view images. Large numbers of vehicle frontal view images are captured by traffic surveillance cameras, so we focus on vehicle type classification from vehicle frontal view images. In this paper, authors proposed a novel framework of vehicle type classification from vehicle frontal view images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The convolutional neural network is a multi-layer feed-forward neural network which is biologically inspired. Unlike traditional methods by using hand-crafted features, the convolutional neural network is able to automatically learn multiple stages of invariant features for the specific task \[10]. The convolutional neural network in \[9] takes an original vehicle image as the input and outputs the probability of each vehicle type to which the vehicle belongs. The convolutional layer computes the convolutions between the input and a set of filters (filter bank), and provide a nonlinear representation of the input signal by using a point-wise nonlinear function. Softmax classifier was adopted as the output layer to calculate the probability of each vehicle type. A supervised learning method is introduced to learn the parameters of the classifier. Unlike traditional methods by using handcrafted visual features, our method is able to automatically learn good features for the classification task.
