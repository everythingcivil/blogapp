**What Makes a Building Green?**

Following examples can be considered for green buildings:

* Green buildings may incorporate sustainable materials in their construction (e.g., reused, recycled content, or made from renewable resources).
* **Create healthy indoor environments with minimal pollutants (e.g., reduced product emissions).**
* And feature landscaping that reduce water usage (e.g., by using native plants that survive without extra watering).
* *A green building is a structure that is environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout its life-cycle. These objectives expand and complement the classical building design concerns of economy, utility. Durability and comfort.*
